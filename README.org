/This package is still a WIP, but I think it's better than the others so I'm publishing/

* Introduction
=org-css= is an =ox-html= theme designed to complement [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes/blob/master/themes/doom-one-theme.el][doom-one]]. It is written in SCSS for added customisability.
** Motivation
I write a lot of things in orgmode and I am often dissapointed with the end product that is exported. This is no issue for me (why would I leave orgmode?), but I often need to share the files with others and this becomes challenging when they don't use emacs (yet).

So what should I export to? The obvious answer would be .md and this is what I tried at first but it has some major drawbacks:
+ the internal links arent synched with org
+ it misses a lot of detail, i.e. no date, no author, some other things I'm forgetting
+ Styling is left up to whatever renderer is on the client

Markdown ended up not being worth it, so I just published bare orgfiles with a disclaimer that yelled at people for not reading them with emacs. But then I decided to try out html exports, as it's even more accessible and it's more customisable.

The issue was that =ox-html= is anything but easy on the eyes out of the box, so I dug around for a nice stylesheet and couldnt find anything that fit my needs, so here we are.
* Installation
To use this stylesheet you must put this at the start of your orgfiles:
#+begin_src org
#+HTML_HEAD:<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://github.com/LiquidZulu/org-css/blob/main/css/org.css"/>
#+end_src
If you dont want to add that by hand every time you make a new .org this little doo dad is what I use for my preambles, edit is as your needs dictate, and stick it in your =.emacs= or your =init.el/org= or whatever you use.
#+begin_src elisp
(setq
 org-css "file:///e:/emacs/documents/org-css/css/org.css") ;; you'll want to change this
(setq
 org-preamble (format
               "#+TITLE:\n#+AUTHOR:LiquidZulu\n#+BIBLIOGRAPHY:e:/Zotero/library.bib\n#+PANDOC_OPTIONS: csl:e:/Zotero/styles/australasian-physical-and-engineering-sciences-in-medicine.csl\n#+HTML_HEAD:<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"%s\"/>\n/This file is best viewed in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]]!/"
               org-css))

(add-hook 'find-file-hook
          (lambda ()
            (if
                (string=
                 (substring
                  (buffer-name)
                  (if (> (length (buffer-name)) 3) (- (length (buffer-name)) 3) 0)
                  nil)
                 "org")
                (if
                    (=
                     (buffer-size)
                     0)
                    ((lambda ()
                       (insert org-preamble)

                                        ; navigate point to end of #+TITLE:, doesnt work when launching from gitbash for some reason, point just moves right back down after doom does something
                       (goto-line 1)
                       (forward-word)
                       (forward-char)))))))
#+end_src

It's also a good idea to up =org-export-headline-levels=, like so:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-export-headline-levels 512) ;; you probably don't need 512, but I like it this way
#+end_src
* Demo
This is some text, introducing a blockquote:
#+begin_quote
Don't trust everything you read on the internet
---Abraham Lincoln
#+end_quote
